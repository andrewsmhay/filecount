# filecount.rb

Filecount is a simple script to:
<ul>
<li>Recursively search through the filesystem</li>
<li>Count the number of files in each directory, and</li>
<li>Display the directory with the total count, sorted by directory name</li>
</ul>

The script has been tested on Windows 2012, Ubuntu 12.04.1, and OS X but should run on any system.

To run the script with the list of directories and counts, simply run:<br />
`./filecount.rb`

To save the pipe '|' delimited output to a file, just redirect to a file on your system:<br />
`./filecount.rb > filecount.csv`
